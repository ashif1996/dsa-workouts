## Features  

- **Algorithms**: Covers all major algorithms like searching, sorting, and more.  
- **Data Structures**: Detailed implementations of arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more.  
- **Modular Design**: Each topic is separated into its own folder for easy navigation.  
- **Roadmap Integration**: Follows the [Data Structures and Algorithms Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms).  

## Getting Started  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-workouts.git  
   cd dsa-workouts  
   ```  

2. **Install Node.js (if not already installed)**:  
   - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  

3. **Run any JavaScript file**:  
   Navigate to a folder and run the file:  
   ```bash  
   node algorithms/binary-search/binarySearch.js  
   ```  

## Usage  

- **Algorithms**: Implement and test various algorithms in their respective folders.  
- **Data Structures**: Understand and implement foundational data structures like arrays, linked lists, graphs, and more.  
- **Exercises**: Practice exercises based on each topic.  

## Roadmap  

This repository aligns with the [Data Structures and Algorithms Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms) to provide a structured learning path.
